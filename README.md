# zk-ai

Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning playground ðŸš€  
Prove and verify ML inference without revealing model weights or private inputs.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- **Circuits**: Build and compile zk-SNARK/zk-STARK circuits (Circom, Halo2, Cairo).
- **Proofs**: Generate & verify proofs for ML model commitments and inference.
- **Rust API**: Host bindings to load models, run inference, and produce proofs.
- **Examples**: Ready-to-run demos (linear regression, sentiment classifier).
- **Benchmarks**: Measure proof size and runtime performance.
- **Docs**: Architecture overview and zkML basics.
